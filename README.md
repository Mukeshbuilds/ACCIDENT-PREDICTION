# ACCIDENT-PREDICTION
Accident Severity Prediction System uses machine learning to predict whether a road accident is likely to be Major or Minor. By analyzing factors like speed, traffic, weather, road and driver conditions, this project aims to raise safety awareness and support smarter, data-driven accident prevention.
#  Accident Severity Prediction System

An AI-powered web application that predicts whether a road accident is likely to be **MAJOR** or **MINOR** based on real-world factors such as vehicle speed, traffic density, weather, road condition, lighting, vehicle type, and driver fatigue.

The goal of this project is to improve road safety awareness using machine learning and an interactive user interface.
